          Twelve years ago, I lost my one and only precious mum to the cold
          hands of death. Mum was a selfless person, she was caring loving and
          fun to be with at the same time she was a disciplinarian, my mum was a
          no nonsense person.
        </p>
        <p>
          When i was much younger i used to think that my mum was too strict
          because she doesn't spare the rod but now that i'm older i realized
          that it was for the best. Her method of upbringing molded me into the
          person i am today and i give her credit for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you left us mum, i thought i was going to die too because you
          were an essential part of me and being the first amoung 8 children, i
          was left with a huge responsibility of bringing them and making sure
          that all the <strong>values</strong> mum <em>imbibed</em> in us does 
          not go to waste even in her absence.

          Mum over these past twelve years, we have been through thick and thin 
          but we your children have all come out strong because of the values, 
          princples, morals and knowledge you imbided in us and we are forever 
          grateful mum. 
          Your death left a vacuum in my heart that cannot be filled, i miss you 
          so much mum, we your children miss you and your husband, our dear father
          miss you too. 
        </p>
